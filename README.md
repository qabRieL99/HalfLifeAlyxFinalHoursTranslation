|On Friday, October 30, 1998, I sent Valve co-founder Gabe Newell an email from the computer lab at the University of Southern California.  “Thanks for taking the time to show me around. I had a great time,” I tapped into the keyboard.|1998 yılının 30 Ekim Cuma günü, Southern California Üniversitesi’ndeki bilgisayar laboratuvarından Valve’ın kurucu ortağı Gabe Newell’a bir e-posta gönderdim. Klavyeye şu satırları yazdım: “Etrafı gezdirdiğin için teşekkür ederim. Harika zaman geçirdim.”|
|I’m not quite sure why I saved that email, or why I kept five different alpha and beta discs from the original Half-Life.  Sensing Valve Software was up to something special, I spent the next few months of my sophomore year writing “The Final Hours of Half-Life,” a behind the scenes look at the making of that game.|O e-postayı neden sakladığımı ya da orijinal Half-Life’a ait beş farklı alfa ve beta diski neden tuttuğumu tam olarak bilmiyorum. Ama Valve Software’ın sıradan bir şey yapmadığını hissediyordum. Bu yüzden üniversitedeki ikinci yılımın sonraki birkaç ayını “Half-Life’ın Son Saatleri” adlı yazıyı yazarak geçirdim. Bu yazı, oyunun perde arkasına dair bir bakış sunuyordu.|
|Over the past 22 years, I’ve chronicled the evolution of Valve with stories about the making of Half-Life 2 (2004) and Portal 2 (2011). Now, nine years later, we return to Valve for “The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx.” This story details the past decade inside the company and the decision to return to Half-Life, a franchise that seemed lost to the ages.|Son 22 yılda, Valve’ın gelişimini konu alan birkaç yazı daha kaleme aldım. Bunlar arasında Half-Life 2’nin (2004) ve Portal 2’nin (2011) yapım süreçlerini anlatan yazılar da var. Ve şimdi, dokuz yıl aradan sonra tekrar Valve’a dönerek “Half-Life: Alyx’in Son Saatleri”ni anlatıyorum. Bu hikâye, şirketin son on yılını ve bir dönem unutulmuş gibi görünen Half-Life serisine geri dönme kararını ele alıyor.|
|I never wrote “The Final Hours of Half-Life” intending to start an anthology spanning multiple decades. Now, looking back, I’m honored to help chronicle an essential part of video game history. In some ways, I feel like Michael Apted, the director of the Up documentary series, who has tracked the lives of the same 14 British children every seven years from the age of 7 up until 63 (and still counting).|İlk “Son Saatler” yazısını hazırlarken bunun onlarca yıla yayılan bir seriye dönüşeceğini hiç düşünmemiştim. Bugün geriye baktığımda, video oyun tarihinin önemli bir bölümünü belgeleyebilmiş olmak benim için büyük bir onur. Kendimi, bir anlamda, 7 yaşından itibaren 14 Britanyalı çocuğun hayatını her yedi yılda bir belgeleyen _Up_ serisinin yönetmeni Michael Apted gibi hissediyorum.|
|Valve is a different place than the scrappy startup I visited in 1997. Back then, I sat on the floor of Gabe’s office as he and his wife assembled Half-Life manuals and dreamed of winning Game of the Month from PC Gamer.|Valve, 1997’de ziyaret ettiğim o küçük ve heyecanlı girişimden çok farklı bir yer artık. O zamanlar Gabe’in ofisinin zemininde oturur, eşiyle birlikte Half-Life kılavuzlarını kutulara yerleştirirlerdi. En büyük hayalleri, PC Gamer dergisinden “Ayın Oyunu” unvanını kazanmaktı.|
|Today Valve is one of the game industry’s most powerful companies -- but certainly not its most prolific or understood. The company’s self-professed, no-hierarchy organizational structure has led to inefficiencies and periods of creative drought. But ultimately, you can’t argue with the result: Half-Life: Alyx is a shining example of what Valve does at its best. |Bugün Valve, oyun dünyasında en güçlü firmalardan biri haline geldi. Ancak bu güce rağmen en üretken ya da en kolay anlaşılan şirket olduğunu söylemek zor. Kendi tanımladıkları hiyerarşisiz çalışma düzeni, zaman zaman verim sorunlarına ve yaratıcı durgunluklara yol açtı. Yine de sonuç ortada: Half-Life: Alyx, Valve’ın en iyi yaptığı işi ortaya koyan bir örnek.|
|With every “Final Hours,” I try to make use of new technologies to bring you closer to the game and the people behind it. Special thanks to David Clark, our incredible Unity software developer, and Chuck Kerr, our talented designer, for helping bring my vision for this Steam app to life.|Her “Son Saatler” yazısında, sizi oyuna ve onun arkasındaki insanlara daha da yaklaştırmak için yeni teknolojilerden faydalanmaya çalışıyorum. Bu Steam uygulamasını hayata geçirmeme yardımcı olan yazılım geliştiricimiz David Clark’a ve yaratıcı tasarımcımız Chuck Kerr’e özel olarak teşekkür ederim.|
|Telling this story would not be possible without the unwavering trust of everyone at Valve. Early on in the project, Greg Coomer, Robin Walker, and Kaci Aitchison Boyle walked me into a team meeting and told everyone to be open and honest about everything – team dynamics, canceled projects, and the overall creative process. For months, I walked around the office and intervie-wed the team in an unstructured and unsupervised way. Thanks to Gabe, Erik Johnson, Doug Lombardi, Jake Rodkin, Roland Shaw, Greg, Robin, Kaci, and everyone at Valve for being so open with me – and your customers. And thanks to my friends and family for their patience. I oversubscribed myself by taking on this project, but Valve’s return to Half-Life is something I simply couldn’t turn down.|Bu hikâyeyi anlatabilmem, Valve ekibinin bana duyduğu sarsılmaz güven sayesinde mümkün oldu. Projenin başında Greg Coomer, Robin Walker ve Kaci Aitchison Boyle beni bir ekip toplantısına davet etti ve herkese, ekip dinamiklerinden iptal edilen projelere kadar her konuda açık ve dürüst olmalarını söylediler. Aylar boyunca ofiste serbestçe dolaştım ve ekip üyeleriyle gözetimsiz şekilde röportajlar yaptım. Gabe, Erik Johnson, Doug Lombardi, Jake Rodkin, Roland Shaw, Greg, Robin, Kaci ve Valve’daki tüm çalışanlara bana ve dolayısıyla oyunculara bu denli açık oldukları için teşekkür ederim. Ayrıca bu süreç boyunca sabır gösteren aileme ve arkadaşlarıma da minnettarım. Bu projeyi üstlenmekle kendimi fazlasıyla meşgul ettim, ama Valve’ın Half-Life’a dönüşü karşı konulacak bir şey değildi.|
|I hope that, no matter what, this story inspires you to see how, after a decade, it is possible to return to something you love and make it even better.|Umarım bu hikâye, ne olursa olsun, on yıl sonra bile sevdiğin bir şeye yeniden dönebileceğini ve onu daha da güzelleştirebileceğini sana gösterir.|
|Thanks for reading,|Okuduğun için teşekkür ederim,|
|Geoff|Geoff|

|When he was nine years old in 1998, James “Jay” Benson would close his eyes and imagine the immersive thrill of playing a specific video game. Growing up the son of a divorced primary school teacher and a Royal Air Force navigator on an AWACS aircraft, Benson, most of the time, lived at his Mum’s house in Southport, England, with nary a computer in sight. But every other weekend, Jay visited Dad and Dad’s PC on the RAF Waddington base. On most Saturdays, Benson and his Dad went fishing or took a bike ride around the shed. But if Jay – or Jazzman, as his Dad called him – was being really honest, all he wanted to do was boot up his Pop’s PC and stand inside his dream: A video game named Half-Life.||
|Since he could only sneak in a couple of hours of gameplay every other weekend, it took young Benson over six months to maneuver his way out of the Black Mesa Research Facility, meet the G-Man, and finish Half-Life (and that was only after carefully copying in his saved game files not to erase his Dad’s). To Jay Benson, and to millions of gamers around the world, playing Half-Life, with its alchemic blend of genre-defining narrative, intense combat, and vibrant ambiance, was a formative experience. Half-Life has cascaded through gaming and popular culture for more than two decades.||
|Some people play and appreciate video games from a distance, treating them as no more than an escapist hobby. Jay Benson, it turns out, is not one of those people. Even in the years after Half-Life’s release, Benson couldn’t stop thinking about the game’s most resonant moments, which tumbled through his mind like lucid dreams.||
|When he flunked out of University at age 17 and started serving baked beans to old ladies at a local cafe, Benson sat in the break room, closed his eyes, and started daydreaming once again. This time he set an audacious personal goal: In three years, he told himself, he was going to get a job working at Valve, one of the most venerated game developers in the world.||
|There was just one problem. Or perhaps many. You see, Jay didn’t have any particular game design skills beyond bashing together what might charitably be described as fanfic levels in the RPG game Neverwinter Nights. He didn’t program. He didn’t draw, although his girlfriend Jenni thought him to be a very creative individual. Undeterred, Jazzman flew to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco to hone, or perhaps better put, to discover his unrevealed craft. His first stop? A game design talk by Robin Walker, a Valve developer behind Team Fortress 2.||
|Galvanized by Walker’s one-hour GDC session, Benson spun into action. He described his mindset to the KritzKast Team Fortress podcast in 2010. “If you want to do something great, feeling relaxed is a bad feeling,’” he said over voice chat. “Why am I going home and browsing the Internet or watching Glee or House when I could be creating something?”||
|Benson formulated a plan: Over the next year, he would teach himself how to create game animation, working at his girlfriend’s parents’ house from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. every day. “I am a withered husk of a man, like the charger in Left 4 Dead 2, just one giant arm clicking a mouse,” Benson explained to the podcast.||
|To track his progress, he wrote down how many frames of animation he completed every day in a Steamworks diary book from GDC. If he didn’t get anything done, he forced himself to write “No finished frames” to memorialize his laziness. On the days he wrote those words, Benson remembered a quote from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell he read in EDGE Magazine: “The greatest fear most people have is being scared for the loss of their abilities.”||
|On June 10, 2010, Benson posted his first animation to YouTube, a 20-second clip of the Sniper in Team Fortress dancing to C+C Music Factory’s “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now).” “I would love if somebody working in the business could tell me a ballpark estimation of how my skill level is doing in regard to being a professional proposition. Thanks for your time,” he posted on the Polycount forum as Jazzmann9575 (the 9575, in case you were wondering, was his iPhone PIN at the time).||
|Benson had a knack for something. His series of whimsical Team Fortress videos gained hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. Emboldened, he turned to Half-Life and spent six weeks creating a re-imagined trailer for the original game with fluid new animations for Gordon Freeman’s hands and in-game enemies like head crabs. The video quickly went viral, amassing over 2 million views. “Animator gets bored waiting, starts creating his own version of Half-Life 3,” read the headline on Geek.com||
|By now, you’re probably wondering when Gabe Newell sends Jay Benson an email inviting him to come work at the dream factory. “Those videos were 100% auditions to get Valve’s attention,” Benson now sheepishly admits. But they didn’t work. The email from Gabe never arrived.||
|Determined to wheedle his way in, Benson applied for a Valve job at age 21, just as he told himself he would. He didn’t get past the phone interview. The second time he applied, Benson managed to get an in-person interview in Seattle. But after taking beta-blockers due to sheer nerves, he screwed up the interview question about designing a villain for Aquaman. It wasn’t meant to be. Hapless, Benson settled for a $22K-a-year job as a junior animator at Lionhead on the canceled Kinect game Milo and Kate. After getting laid off there, he worked on animation for a series of acclaimed games: The indie darling Ori and the Blind Forest and Campo Santo’s brilliant Firewatch.||
|No matter what game he was animating, Benson kept a totem by his desk-side: His Dad’s CD jewel case for the original Half-Life with a PC Gamer “Game of the Month” sticker on it. With his Valve dreams thwarted, Benson, like the rest of the gaming world, carried a faint hope for a consolation prize: Getting to play a new Half-Life game, which saw its last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, released 13 years ago in 2007.||
|It’s Monday, February 3, 2020, the day after the Superbowl at 3 p.m. sharp. Just off the lobby of Valve’s 14th-floor office in Bellevue, Washington, a stream of people begins to file into a large, open room customarily reserved for VR playtesting. In total, more than 80 employees of Valve – nearly one-quarter of the company – are arriving for the weekly status meeting on Half-Life: Alyx. This full-on virtual reality game marks Valve’s triumphant return to both the Half-Life franchise and single-player story-driven games.||
|“This is sort of the battle of Helm’s Deep in terms of Valve, the largest team we’ve ever had on a project,” explains Jim Hughes, a Valve designer and Star Wars super-fan who, in his spare time, kit bashes and 3D prints models of TIE Bombers and X-Wings. One day he plans to re-film the Death Star trench run in his living room.||
|As the developers circle up around product lead Robin Walker, it’s hard not to be struck by the generations represented – and that the team is still predominantly male and white, something Greg Coomer at Valve acknowledges it needs to fix. There are veterans who shipped the original Half-Life more than two decades ago next to those who worked on the equally acclaimed Half-Life 2 in 2004. Sprinkled amongst them are a new batch of developers who joined Valve in the past decade, hoping that they might, one day, get to help create a new Half-Life.||
|One of the people in that that last category nervously stands off to the side in an oxford shirt, gnawing at the plastic top of a water bottle. His name? The Jazzman himself, Jay Benson, who joined Valve when it acquired Campo Santo in 2018. (We could tell you the story about how, when Benson received access to Valve’s computer network, he summarily downloaded every canceled project and was flagged by IT as a hacker, but we’ll spare him that full embarrassment).||
|With the group assembled in a semi-circle, Walker stands between two whiteboards filled with words and charts. One board correlates team member names, such as Tristan Reidford, with tasks like finishing the weapon skins. (Tristan refuses to play any section of the game with a headcrab because it freaks him out in VR).||
|The other whiteboard is a calendar for the next six weeks broken into three phases: “final development,” “serious bugs only,” and “showstoppers only,” meaning bugs that would cause the game to crash. If everything goes according to plan, it all culminates on March 20, circled in red as the date Half-Life: Alyx will be complete after four years of top-secret development.||
|As the meeting begins, Walker, an affable Australian with a well-coifed development beard, looks around and addresses the assembled mass.||
|“A lot of people are setting their bugs to critical because it’s the default. Please check if it’s really critical before logging it that way,” he says. “Also, someone has been trying to simulate playing the game through with one functional arm. We want to support this, so we need an owner that can take that on.”||
|“Any update on perf?” Walker asks, shorthand for inquiring if there are any issues with the game’s frame rate dropping, a critical issue in a VR game that needs to run at 90 frames per second in 3D.||
|“It’s starting to look better than it has in a while, so that’s promising,” responds Michael Coupland, an 11-year veteran of Valve who admits he hasn’t yet shipped a game at Valve because his projects keep getting canceled. “But please prioritize minimum spec machines on your playtests,” he tells the team.||
|At the opposite end of the room, Dario Casali, who designed levels for the original Half-Life some 22 years ago, throws out a question about the level he’s been heading up. The Vault, as it’s known, is the final sequence, which has gone through a significant overhaul in the past six months.||
|“Are we still getting external playtesters through?” he asks the room.||
|“Yes, but the last two couldn’t get through to the end of the game…schedule problems,” explains designer Jeff Lane, who heads up the playtests when he isn’t racing motorcycles.||
|“Well, I’m not getting enough external data on the last map,” Casali admonishes the group. “We have three weeks to change the balance, and not enough people are playing through it.”||
|Finally, Walker turns to his right. He looks to Benson, probably not even realizing he inspired him to get into game development a decade ago.||
|“Jay, how are the gameplay videos coming together?”||
|Benson, tasked with editing a series of three gameplay videos for YouTube, opens his eyes wide, lifts his chin, and cracks a smile.||
|“Oh, quite well!” he says. “The subway survival horror video is watchable now, and I’d love some feedback from you guys!”||
|To some, Half-Life: Alyx represents nothing more than an ambitious – bordering on absurd – virtual reality experiment for a limited audience. (After all, just 1% of Steam customers own a VR headset). But to those who know Valve best, Alyx serves as a much bigger inflection point for one of the video game industry’s most revered studios. Often seen as mysterious, impenetrable, and downright unpredictable, Valve’s traditional game output has dramatically decreased (or rather downright stopped) over the past decade. Flush with billions of dollars in revenues from Steam – Valve’s industry-leading PC distribution service – some wondered if Valve was impervious to its clamoring fanbase and resigned to let Half-Life live on only in our memories. Half-Life: Alyx proves otherwise.||
|“We get that there’s this public perception that everyone who worked on Half-Life left and that Valve doesn’t know how to make those games any-more,” explains Phil Co, a veteran Valve level designer. “Part of what motivated us on this project was to show everyone what this place is still capable of creating.”||
|As it turns out, Valve has been creating over the past decade – with little of that work publicly exposed. Half-Life: Alyx, for instance, represents at least Valve’s sixth attempt to do something new with the Half-Life property since Half-Life 2: Episode Two ended in 2007 with the illusory promise of Half-Life 2: Episode Three. Valve is in the unique position of having what poet Adrienne Rich phrased the “gift for burning.” Unlike many other creative studios, Valve has the luxury – or you could argue, the curse – of shutting down and redoing projects ad infinitum until something emerges that is deemed worthy of its customers’ time and money.||
|Now, for the first time, Valve opens up about the past decade behind closed doors. From the canceled projects, the struggles to create a new game engine, and a bet-the-company push into hardware and virtual reality, shipping Half-Life: Alyx is the bright end of a decade-long season filled with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.||
|“A lot of people came to Valve because of what they thought it represented, and it hasn’t always been that place the past decade,” Walker openly admits to me one afternoon. “For those of us who were here in our first decade, we knew Valve could still be that. Some of this project was about trying to give the people who joined Valve in the second decade that experience we felt in the first.”||
|Walker pauses for a minute and closes his eyes, as if to remember the indescribable yet magical feeling that comes with shipping a genre-defining game. It is perhaps the exact feeling that young, impressionable Jay Benson picked up on when he heard Walker’s talk back in 2010 at the Game Developers Conference.||
|Walker then continues speaking in a way that suggests, like any good programmer, he’s found a more efficient way to express his thoughts.||
|“I guess you could say this is the story of how we fixed Valve.”||
